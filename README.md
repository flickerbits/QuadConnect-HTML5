# QuadConnect-HTML5
a version of the game using only HTML5 and JavaScript with no other dependencies

**QuadConnect** is a game in which two players take turns dropping game pieces from the top of a seven-column, six-row game board. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line of four of one's own game pieces.

## Controls
* Left Arrow  - Move one space left
* Right Arrow - Move one space right
* Down Arrow  - Drop game piece into current column
* Up Arrow    - Reset game

When a player successfully executes a **QuadConnect**, the background turns orange and the winning pieces are highlighted!

## History

QuadConnect was originally a one-day project to learn about the **p5.js** library.
This inspired me to code this version with HTML5 + JavaScript and **no dependencies**.
